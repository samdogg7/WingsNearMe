# WingsNearMe
Wings Near Me is an app used to find the nearest chicken wings at your location!

The app is currently a work in progress that I use to create proof of concepts, learn new skills, and to demonstrate my ability as an iOS developer.

Some of the highlights of the project include:
- A generic api request handler
- Working with external apis
- Lottie Animations
- MapKit
