I mentioned it to our waitress, she agreed it looked short, she brought it back to the bartender and was informed it was indeed the correct amount and pointed to the \"fill line\" which was basically at the bottom of the glass. Also no bread for the table, it's an additional $10.95, everything was overpriced, maybe that's why the place was empty? That doesn't explain why the food took forever to arrive. There are so many better values around, sorry I cannot recommend Rev Kitchen & Bar.",
