Lots of big screens showing different games. Pool table and 'hoops' machine. I can't remember our server's name but she was fantastic. Friendly, quick service with a smile. I have to say I was happily surprised to see Poutine on the menu....I promptly ordered it. Poutine is IMO the perfect snack when you are drinking. Fries or tots(!) Covered in delicious beef gravy with melted cheese on top. These were some,of the best I've had. The martinis were very good too. My only issue here is that all of their seats are hard wooden barstools. Def NOT handicapped friendly, otherwise I'm happy we tried it!",
