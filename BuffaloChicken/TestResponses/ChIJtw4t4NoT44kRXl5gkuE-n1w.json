Nothing against the wait staff . Just never had a great experience with the food .",

I just don’t understand in a time when all restaurants need the money but they can’t get it right and try to say it was the right order, 35.00 for 18 wings is not the right order.

At one point someone had to walk back to the kitchen to find someone as no one was around for an extended period of time. \n\nWhen an employee did show up to finally hand out takeout orders I had to ask him 3 separate times to please put on his mask that he was not wearing around his chin. Every customer was wearing at least a mask if not gloves. It was a complete disregard of public health and social responsibility during this time. \n\nThe food was also very disappointing as they combined the chicken tenders with the cheese wedges, and forgot all dipping sauces and vegetables. Was also 30 mins past the time we were supposed to pick up\n\nIronically, the the receipt includes a reviewed by, which was left blank.\n\nAs a customer for over a decade I am shocked  and I can confidently say this will be the last time I order from Buffalo Wild Wings.",
