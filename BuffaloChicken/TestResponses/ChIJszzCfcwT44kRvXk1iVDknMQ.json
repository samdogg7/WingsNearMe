I had a pulled pork, Dixie chicken, and ribs combo with some brisket (no beans) chili.  Everything was very good, but chicken was fantastic, as was the chili.  Partner had brisket and loved it.  I highly recommend them.  Service was stupid fast.",

BBQ sauce was tasty enough from the dispensers, but the overall flavors of my pulled pork and ribs had traces of like, \"carbon\" in it?? I don't know. Regardless, it sated my cravings and I have a happy belly.",
