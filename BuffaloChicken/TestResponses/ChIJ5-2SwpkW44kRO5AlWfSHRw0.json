I ordered  a veggie supreme pizza because I did not want ricotta cheese on my pizza. I was so frustrated to see a pizza delivered with the wrong veggies on it and globs of ricotta cheese. I hope you will retrain whoever is cooking for you.. We spent $40 tonight and did not get what we ordered.. A waste of our hard earned money.",
