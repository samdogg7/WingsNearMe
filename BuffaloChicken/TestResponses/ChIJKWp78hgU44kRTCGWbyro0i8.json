Severe lack and quality of ingredients on the \"Happy Life Pizza\", especially when compared to the supposed picture on GrubHub. Taste was ok but I found the crust tough as well. Definitely not worth the price. Mike's Pizzeria is much better. Won't be ordering again.",

I told the employee who felt bad, and had me speak to the manager, Dana. He did the opposite of helping me and instead told me that’s how their pizzas are served, even though I saw other customers eating pizzas that weren’t burnt. As he got angry and made me feel threatened, I walked out and will never go back. The restaurant wants to make money rather than satisfying customers. I wouldn’t go here if I were you, unless you want a bad experience.",
