I could literally eat this every day of my life. \n\nI know that sounds cliche but I'm someone who doesn't eat pizza...ever. I nearly starved as a child at birthday parties watching other kids eat pizza and as a hungover college student.\n\nThis is Italian style pizza. It reminds me of TC Landos (978 represent) back in the day when the family ran the shops and the pizza was authentic. \n\nOh and their curly fries are out of this world!\n\nHell yea for thin crust pizza outside of the city. If you're looking for a go-to place, don't pass up Reach for the Pie!",
